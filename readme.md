security best practices:

HTTPS Only: Always use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit
Password Hashing: Store only hashed passwords using bcrypt or Argon2
Token Management: Keep tokens short-lived and implement refresh tokens
Rate Limiting: Protect against brute force attacks
Input Validation: Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks
CORS Configuration: Restrict cross-origin requests appropriately
Secure Headers: Implement security headers like HSTS and CSP
Audit Logging: Log authentication events for security monitoring
